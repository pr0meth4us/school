    "## What's Pandas for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has so many uses that it might make sense to list the things it can't do instead of what it can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is essentially your data’s home. Through pandas, you get acquainted with your data by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - What's the average, median, max, or min of each column? \n",
    "    - Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
    "    - What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize the data with help from Matplotlib. Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you jump into the modeling or the complex visualizations you need to have a good understanding of the nature of your dataset and pandas is the best avenue through which to do that.\n",

    "## How does pandas fit into the data science or machine learning toolkit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is the pandas library a central component of the ML or data science toolkit but it is used in conjunction with other libraries in that collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is built on top of the **NumPy** package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in **SciPy**, plotting functions from **Matplotlib**, and machine learning algorithms in **Scikit-learn**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks offer a good environment for using pandas to do data exploration and modeling, but pandas can also be used in text editors just as easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks give us the ability to execute code in a particular cell as opposed to running the entire file. This saves a lot of time when working with large datasets and complex transformations. Notebooks also provide an easy way to visualize pandas’ DataFrames and plots. As a matter of fact, this article was created entirely in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When should you start using pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have any experience coding in Python, then you should stay away from learning pandas until you do. You don’t have to be at the level of the software engineer, but you should be adept at the basics, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, and iterations. Also, I’d also recommend familiarizing yourself with **NumPy** due to the similarities mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking for a good place to learn Python, [Python for Everybody](https://www.learndatasci.com/out/coursera-programming-everybody-getting-started-python/) on Coursera is great (and Free).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, for those of you looking to do a [data science bootcamp](https://www.learndatasci.com/articles/thinkful-data-science-online-bootcamp-review/) or some other accelerated data science education program, it's highly recommended you start learning pandas on your own before you start the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though accelerated programs teach you pandas, better skills beforehand means you'll be able to maximize time for learning and mastering the more complicated material."
